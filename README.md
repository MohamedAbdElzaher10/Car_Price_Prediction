# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate car prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset containing various features of cars, such as model, year, fuel type, mileage, and more, we aim to create a robust model that can accurately predict car prices.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about cars, with the following key features:
- `Model`: The car's model.
- `Year`: The year of manufacture.
- `Fuel Type`: The type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).
- `Kilometers`: The total distance traveled by the car.
- `Transmission`: The type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).
- `Price`: The price of the car (the target variable).

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing or invalid values and converted categorical features into numerical formats to facilitate model training.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted visual and statistical analysis to understand relationships between different features and their impact on car prices.

### 2. **Feature Selection**
   - Implemented techniques like iterative feature selection and feature importance analysis to identify the most influential features affecting car prices.

### 3. **Model Building**
   - Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure the model's generalization capability.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used metrics like R-squared  to evaluate model performance.
   - Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the selected model using Grid Search and Random Search to optimize its accuracy.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Handling Missing Data**
   - **Challenge**: The dataset contained missing values, which could skew the model's predictions.
   - **Solution**: Employed imputation techniques, such as filling missing values with the mean or the most frequent value, depending on the feature.

### 2. **Model Bias**
   - **Challenge**: The initial model showed bias towards certain features, such as the year of manufacture, leading to reduced accuracy.
   - **Solution**: Addressed this by experimenting with different algorithms and using techniques like bias reduction and feature scaling to balance the model's predictions.

### 3. **Improving Model Performance**
   - **Challenge**: The model's performance was initially suboptimal.
   - **Solution**: Enhanced the model by hyperparameter tuning, implementing dimensionality reduction techniques, and using ensemble methods to increase prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion
The final model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities for car prices, making it a valuable tool for decision-making in the automotive market. Whether buying or selling a car, this model provides data-driven insights to ensure fair pricing.

## Future Work
Potential future enhancements include:
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse features.
- Integrating advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time price predictions.
